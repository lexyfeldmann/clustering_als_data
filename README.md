# **Weather API Exploratory Analysis**


**Project Overview**

This notebook analyzes historical weather data retrieved from an API to uncover trends, patterns, and potential relationships between different meteorological variables. The dataset includes metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. The objective was to better understand weather behavior over time and explore how various conditions interact, which can be valuable for applications like agriculture planning, event scheduling, and renewable energy forecasting.

**Methods & Results**

I started by importing and structuring the API data into a usable format, followed by handling missing values and ensuring consistent data types. Visual exploratory analysis was then conducted to identify seasonal patterns, temperature fluctuations, and precipitation trends. Correlation analysis revealed strong relationships between temperature and humidity in certain months, as well as expected seasonal rainfall shifts. Additionally, time-series plots illustrated how different weather factors varied across days, months, and seasons, making it easier to spot anomalies or extreme weather events.

**Key Outputs**

- Cleaned and structured weather dataset from API data
- Seasonal trend visualizations for temperature and precipitation
- Correlation heatmaps between key weather variables
- Time-series plots highlighting short- and long-term patterns

**Conclusion**
This analysis provided a clear view of seasonal weather patterns and the relationships between climate variables. By building on this work, organizations could integrate real-time API data for forecasting models, plan seasonal operations more effectively, and anticipate conditions that impact agriculture, events, or infrastructure.
